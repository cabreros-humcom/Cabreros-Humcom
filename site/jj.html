            <p>Five top trends for 2021 in Artificial Inteligence and Machine<br>
            Learning (AI/ML) for staying ahead of the curve. What is<br>
            important for being effective for applying algorithms in coding<br>
            to utilize data to solve problems?<br></h>
            <br>
            <b>Blockchain,</b> is a technology that uses a sequential set of<br>
            transaction leaving a defines register of events and process<br>
            for combining task. Fusing AI/ML and blackchain and data<br>
            solutionsis coming.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Cloud,</b> is scalable and virtual environments. These are available<br>
            to set users with no physical location or provision requirment.<br>
            Cloud creates a different model for IT and data servise by not<br>
            restricting architecture bt physical requirments.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Electrical Artificial Intellegence,</b> is a field study, and<br>
            implementation of frameworks for limiting or eliminating bias in<br>
            algorithms. This involves evaluating a solution for data uses and<br>
            implementations for cultural and social impact.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Interoperability,</i> using APIs and libraries together through<br>
            replication or scripting across stacks for easy implementations,<br>
            having reusable and expandible blocks for coding across<br>
            platforms such as amazon Wed service, Microsoft Azure, SAP,<br>
            snoflake, and more.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Security,</b> keeping data safe trough stewardship. Both inovation<br>
            and workflow will be a topic for 2021 to enhance security<br>
            methods for specialized data services based on Artificial<br>
            Intellegence  and Machine to differenciate from software<br>
            developments norms.<br>
            <br>
            The way to stay ahead is to know the list of technologies that<br>
            touch a domain and achieve proficiency in them for incorporation<br>
            into task to maintain productivity. The five themesfor 2021<br>
            for maintaning relevance in AI/ML: Blockchain, cloud, Ethical<br>
            Artificial Intellegence (AI), interoperability, and Security<br>
            (Cybersecurity).</p><br>

        <p>Institutions, especially in health care, are working to lower <br>
        the exposure of Covid-19 to patients and workers. Many private <br>
        and public practices have started implementing more telehealth <br>
        offerings such as doctor-patient video chats, A.I. avatar-based <br>
        diagnostics, and no-contact-based medication delivery.<br><br>
        
        Telehealth visits have surged by 50 percent compared with pre-<br>
        pandemic levels. IHS Technology predicted that 70 million <br>
        Americans would use telehealth by 2020. Since then, Forrester <br>
        Research predicted the number of U.S. virtual care visits will <br>
        reach almost a billion early in 2021.<br><br>

        Teladoc Health, Amwell, Livongo Health, One Medical, and Humana <br>
        are some of the public companies offering telehealth services to <br>
        meet the current needs.Startups are not far behind. Startups <br>
        like MDLive, MeMD, iCliniq, K Health, 98point6, Sense.ly, <br>
        and Eden Health have also contributed toward meeting the growing <br>
        needs in 2020, and will continue offering creative solutions in <br>
        2021. Beyond telehealth, in 2021 we can expect to see health <br>
        care advancements in biotech and A.I., as well as machine <br>
        learning opportunities (example: Suki AI) to support diagnosis, <br>
        admin work, and robotic health care.<br>

        <p><b>Educational Technology Trends In 2020-2021</b><br><br>
            Big Data, Machine Learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) <br>
            were the biggest educational technology trends of 2019. However, <br>
            distance learning has become the one trend that rules them all. <br>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way we teach <br>
            and learn. Students now have to get used to distance learning <br>
            via digital platforms due to social distancing. Even though some <br>
            schools are reopening, this trend may continue until 2021. The <br>
            latest EdTech trends in 2020, and further into 2021 are being <br>
            revolutionized with a strong focus on connectivity, versatility, <br>
            and student-centered learning. Letâs take a look at the latest <br>
            top 10 trends in educational technology.<br><br>
