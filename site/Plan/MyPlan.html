                <h2>God has given you a purpose for your life. But there's a<br>
                problem. Actually, a million problems. They're called distruction.</h2>

                <h4><p style="font-family: 'Courier New' ">25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?

                    28 “And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. 29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. 30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you—you of little faith? 31 So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. 33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</h4></center>

                <h4><p style="font-family: 'Courier New' ">Oo tama madaming distructions, lalo sa part ko ng pag-aaral "Online"<br>
                    actually before ko gawin ito nag one games mona ako but the letter S is silent haha.<br>
                    Yung <font color="red">Focus</font> ko kay Lord honestly minsan talaga nawawala naibabaling<br>
                    ko sa ibang bagay or gawain, pag nagbabasa ako ng Bible sa phone tapos may notif lang ako na<br>
                    ma receive wala na, kaboom.<br>

                    Alam niyo yung Blinkers or Blinders para sa Horses? Ito is to prevent the horse seeing to the rear and, in some cases, to the side.<br>
                    mukhang kailangan natin ito mga kapatid para mabawasan ang mga nakikita nating distructions at yung<br>
                    Worship natin kay Lord ay mapalakas natin.<br>
