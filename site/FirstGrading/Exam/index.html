        Five top trends for 2021 in Artificial Inteligence and Machine<br>
        Learning (AI/ML) for staying ahead of the curve. What is<br>
        important for being effective for applying algorithms in coding<br>
        to utilize data to solve problems?<br>
        <br>
        <b>Blockchain,</b> is a technology that uses a sequential set of<br>
        transaction leaving a defines register of events and process<br>
        for combining task. Fusing AI/ML and blackchain and data<br>
        solutionsis coming.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Cloud,</b> is scalable and virtual environments. These are available<br>
        to set users with no physical location or provision requirment.<br>
        Cloud creates a different model for IT and data servise by not<br>
        restricting architecture bt physical requirments.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Electrical Artificial Intellegence,</b> is a field study, and<br>
        implementation of frameworks for limiting or eliminating bias in<br>
        algorithms. This involves evaluating a solution for data uses and<br>
        implementations for cultural and social impact.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Interoperability,</i> using APIs and libraries together through<br>
        replication or scripting across stacks for easy implementations,<br>
        having reusable and expandible blocks for coding across<br>
        platforms such as amazon Wed service, Microsoft Azure, SAP,<br>
        snoflake, and more.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Security,</b> keeping data safe trough stewardship. Both inovation<br>
        and workflow will be a topic for 2021 to enhance security<br>
        methods for specialized data services based on Artificial<br>
        Intellegence  and Machine to differenciate from software<br>
        developments norms.<br>
        <br>

        The way to stay ahead is to know the list of technologies that<br>
        touch a domain and achieve proficiency in them for incorporation<br>
        into task to maintain productivity. The five themesfor 2021<br>
        for maintaning relevance in AI/ML: Blockchain, cloud, Ethical<br>
        Artificial Intellegence (AI), interoperability, and Security<br>
        (Cybersecurity).
